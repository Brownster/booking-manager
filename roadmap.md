# Integrated Implementation & Validation Roadmap
## 13-Week Quality-Driven Development Plan

---

## Executive Summary

This roadmap merges development and quality assurance activities into four sequential phases, ensuring testing is embedded from day one. Each phase includes specific development tasks paired with corresponding validation activities, creating a continuous integration and quality assurance process.

**Key Principle:** *Quality is built-in, not bolted-on.*

---

## Phase 0: Setup and Foundations (Week 1)

**Objective:** Establish infrastructure, tooling, and quality gates before any business logic is written.

### Development Tasks

| Task | Details | Owner | Acceptance Criteria |
|------|---------|-------|-------------------|
| **Finalize Tech Stack** | Choose Node.js/Express + PostgreSQL + Redis OR Python/FastAPI equivalent | Lead Dev | Stack documented with version pinning |
| **Create Docker Environment** | docker-compose.yml with PostgreSQL, Redis, and app services | DevOps | `docker-compose up` fully initializes all services |
| **Project Structure Setup** | Initialize backend (services, models, controllers) and frontend (components, hooks, pages) directories | Lead Dev | Both projects have clear folder organization and package.json scripts |
| **Database Connection Pool** | Configure connection pooling (e.g., node-pg-pool or SQLAlchemy) | Backend Dev | Connection pooling tested with concurrent requests |
| **Environment Configuration** | Create .env.example with all required variables | DevOps | All services read from .env correctly |

### Validation & QA Tasks

| Task | Details | Owner | Acceptance Criteria |
|------|---------|-------|-------------------|
| **Select Test Tools** | Choose testing frameworks (Jest/Pytest), E2E tools (Playwright/Cypress), load testing (K6/JMeter) | QA Lead | Tool selections documented with reasoning |
| **Setup Test Data Factories** | Create Faker/Factory Boy fixtures for User, Tenant, Skill, Calendar, Appointment models | QA Dev | Factories generate realistic, valid data; can be seeded deterministically |
| **Configure CI/CD Pipeline** | Set up GitHub Actions/GitLab CI to run linter and a basic "Hello World" unit test on every commit | DevOps | Pipeline runs automatically on all pull requests |
| **Create Test Infrastructure** | Set up test database (separate from dev), test Redis instance, test API base URL | QA Dev | Test environment is isolated and can be reset between test runs |
| **Baseline Documentation** | Create testing strategy document, tool configurations, and setup guides | QA Lead | Team can spin up testing environment independently |

### Key Deliverables

- ✅ Fully functional Docker environment (all services up and healthy)
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline executing on every commit
- ✅ Test infrastructure ready with factories and fixtures
- ✅ Team can run `npm run test` / `pytest` successfully
- ✅ Project structure follows DRY principles with clear separation of concerns

### Risk Mitigation

- **Database Performance:** Use connection pooling from day one to prevent bottlenecks later
- **CI/CD Delays:** Optimize pipeline (parallel jobs, caching) now to prevent slow feedback cycles
- **Environment Drift:** Use infrastructure-as-code (docker-compose, .env) to prevent "works on my machine" issues

---

## Phase 1: MVP & Core Data (Weeks 2-5)

**Objective:** Build foundational authentication, data models, and the critical Availability Search Algorithm with strong unit and integration test coverage.

### Development Tasks

#### Identity & Authentication (Week 2)
