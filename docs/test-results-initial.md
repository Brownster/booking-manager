# Initial Test Run Results

**Date:** 2025-10-16 00:15 UTC
**Status:** ‚úÖ PARTIAL SUCCESS - Database connection working, 7 tests passing

---

## Executive Summary

### Results: üü° PROGRESS MADE

- **Tests Passed:** 7/23 (30%)
- **Test Suites Passed:** 1/6 (auth tests)
- **Database Connection:** ‚úÖ WORKING
- **Main Issue:** Foreign key constraint violations (missing tenant data in factories)

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Database Connection Issue (RESOLVED)

**Problem:** `SASL: SCRAM-SERVER-FIRST-MESSAGE: client password must be a string`

**Root Cause:**
- `.env` file was missing (tests were trying to connect without credentials)
- Connection string parsing had issues with password parameter
- `NODE_ENV='test'` was being set after dotenv loaded

**Solution Applied:**
1. Created `.env` file from `.env.example`
2. Created test database: `booking_system_test`
3. Modified `backend/src/config/database.js` to use explicit connection parameters for tests instead of connection string:
   ```javascript
   const poolConfig = isTest ? {
     host: 'localhost',
     port: 5432,
     database: 'booking_system_test',
     user: 'booking_user',
     password: 'booking_password',
     // ...
   } : {
     connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
     // ...
   };
   ```
4. Updated `backend/tests/setup.js` to load dotenv before imports

## Primary Failure Cause

### Foreign Key Constraint Violation

**Error:**
```
error: insert or update on table "users" violates foreign key constraint "users_tenant_id_fkey"
```

**Root Cause:**
The test factories are trying to create users without first creating the associated tenant record.

**Affected Files:**
- `tests/factories/userFactory.js`
- Test files: appointments, calendars, availability, skills

**Stack Trace Example:**
```
at query (src/config/database.js:53:20)
at createUserFactory (tests/factories/userFactory.js:24:20)
at setupCalendar (tests/integration/appointments.test.js:23:20)
```

**Analysis:**
- The factories are being called in the correct order in test files
- The `createTenant()` factory is likely working (auth tests pass)
- The issue is that other test files may not be creating tenants first
- OR the `resetDatabase()` is deleting tenants between tests

## Code Coverage Results

### Overall Coverage: 38.58% (Target: 70%)

| Metric | Actual | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Statements** | 38.58% | 70% | ‚ùå Below target |
| **Branches** | 13.89% | 70% | ‚ùå Below target |
| **Functions** | 25% | 70% | ‚ùå Below target |
| **Lines** | 39.11% | 70% | ‚ùå Below target |

### Coverage by Component:

**üü¢ Excellent Coverage (>80%):**
- `src/routes/*` - 100% (all route files)
- `src/validators/*` - 86.2%
- `auth.service.js` - 83.67%
- `token.service.js` - 89.47%
- `user.repository.js` - 80.95%
- `token.repository.js` - 85.71%
- `jwt.js` - 83.33%

**üü° Moderate Coverage (40-80%):**
- `app.js` - 63.63%
- `error.js` - 64.28%
- `password.js` - 72.72%
- `tenant.repository.js` - 57.14%

**üî¥ Low Coverage (<40%):**
- `availability.service.js` - 11.03% ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL (New code not tested)**
- `appointment.service.js` - 10.38%
- `calendar.service.js` - 16.27%
- `skill.service.js` - 18.18%

## Recommended Fixes (Priority Order)

### üî• HIGH PRIORITY (Fix Today)

#### 1. Fix Tenant Factory in Tests

**Problem:** Tests create users before tenants exist

**Solution A - Fix resetDatabase Order:**
Check `tests/utils/resetDb.js` - ensure it doesn't delete tenants that tests need

**Solution B - Ensure Tenant Creation:**
Verify all test files that use `createUserFactory()` first call `createTenant()`:
```javascript
// Good pattern (auth.test.js - working)
const tenant = await createTenant();
const user = await createUserFactory({ tenantId: tenant.id, ... });

// Bad pattern (if any tests skip tenant creation)
const user = await createUserFactory({ tenantId: 'some-uuid', ... });
```

**Files to Check:**
- `tests/integration/skills.test.js`
- `tests/integration/calendars.test.js`
- `tests/integration/availability.test.js`
- `tests/integration/appointments.test.js`

#### 2. Fix Redis Connection for Auth Tests

Two auth tests failing:
- Refresh token test
- Logout test

These likely need Redis to be running properly. Verify:
```bash
docker compose ps redis
docker compose logs redis
```

**Check:** Is `redisClient.connect()` being called in setup.js before tests run?

---

### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY (This Week)

#### 3. Test Data Isolation

**Issue:** `resetDatabase()` in setup.js runs `beforeEach`, which may be too aggressive

**Current Pattern (tests/setup.js:29-31):**
```javascript
beforeEach(async () => {
  await resetDatabase();  // Deletes ALL data including tenants
});
```

**Better Pattern:**
```javascript
beforeEach(async () => {
  // Only reset data tables, keep reference data (tenants)
  await resetAppointments();
  await resetCalendars();
  await resetSkills();
  // DON'T reset users or tenants - tests create their own
});
```

OR

**Use Transactions (Recommended in roadmap):**
```javascript
beforeEach(async () => {
  await pool.query('BEGIN');
});

afterEach(async () => {
  await pool.query('ROLLBACK');  // Auto-cleanup without manual deletes
});
```

#### 4. Add Missing Unit Tests

**Missing (per code-review.md):**
- `tests/unit/utils/jwt.test.js` - JWT generation/verification
- `tests/unit/utils/password.test.js` - Bcrypt operations
- `tests/unit/utils/timezone.test.js` - DST edge cases ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**
- `tests/unit/services/availability.test.js` - Search algorithm logic

These would increase coverage significantly and catch edge cases.

---

### üîµ LOW PRIORITY (Next Week)

#### 5. Improve Test Performance

**Current:** 44 seconds for 23 tests (1.9s per test average)

**Optimizations:**
- Use transactions instead of resetDatabase() (faster cleanup)
- Run test suites in parallel (Jest already does this)
- Mock external services where possible

#### 6. Add Test Data Factories

**Create realistic test data generators:**
- `tests/factories/skillFactory.js`
- `tests/factories/calendarFactory.js`
- `tests/factories/appointmentFactory.js`

Use `@faker-js/faker` for realistic data generation.

---

## Quick Fix Guide for Developer

### To Get All Tests Passing:

**Step 1: Check tenant creation in failing tests**
```bash
cd backend
grep -n "createTenant" tests/integration/*.test.js
```

**Expected:** Every test file should create a tenant before creating users

**Step 2: Verify Redis is connected**
```bash
docker compose logs redis | grep -i error
```

**Step 3: Check resetDatabase logic**
```bash
cat tests/utils/resetDb.js
```

Look for the order of table deletions - `tenants` should be deleted LAST or not at all during tests.

**Step 4: Run specific failing test to debug**
```bash
npm test -- tests/integration/skills.test.js --verbose
```

**Step 5: Fix and rerun all tests**
```bash
npm test
```

## What's Working Well ‚úÖ

1. **Database Connection:** Properly configured with test database
2. **Migrations:** Running successfully (tables created)
3. **Auth System:** Core functionality working (register, login, me endpoints)
4. **Test Infrastructure:** Jest setup, factories pattern, integration test structure
5. **Code Quality:** Validators have 86% coverage, routes have 100%

---

## What Needs Attention ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **Test Data Management:** Tenant/user relationships in factories
2. **Redis Integration:** May not be fully connected for all tests
3. **Coverage:** Need unit tests for utilities and services
4. **Availability Search:** 0% coverage due to test setup failures (but code is implemented!)

---

## Performance Notes

**Test Execution Time:** 44 seconds for 23 tests
- Unit tests: ~15 seconds (2 tests)
- Integration tests: ~29 seconds (21 tests)
- Database operations are the bottleneck

**Recommendations:**
- Switch to transaction-based test isolation (faster than TRUNCATE)
- Consider test database connection pooling optimization

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Today):

1. ‚úÖ Database connection working
2. ‚ùå **TODO:** Fix tenant foreign key issue in test factories
3. ‚ùå **TODO:** Verify Redis connection for auth tests
4. ‚ùå **TODO:** Get all 23 tests passing

### This Week:

5. Add unit tests for utilities (jwt, password, timezone)
6. Add unit tests for availability search algorithm
7. Improve test data isolation (transactions vs truncate)
8. Address npm audit vulnerabilities (2 moderate severity)

### Next Week (Phase 1 Completion):

9. Achieve ‚â•70% code coverage
10. Add E2E tests with Playwright
11. Performance baseline testing
12. API documentation
