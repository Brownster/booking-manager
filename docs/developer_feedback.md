# Developer Feedback and Next Steps

This document provides a summary of the project progress against the roadmap and outlines the immediate priorities.

## Overall Assessment

Excellent progress has been made on the backend implementation for Phase 1. The work completed aligns well with the architecture and goals defined in the `phase-1-strategy.md` and `phase-1-implementation-plan.md` documents.

### What's Going Well

*   **Solid Foundation**: The persistence layer, including migrations and the Jest test setup, is robust and follows the plan perfectly.
*   **Well-Structured Application**: The separation of the Express app from the server, structured error handling, and the modular router system are all implemented as designed.
*   **Core Features Delivered**: The authentication system and the CRUD stacks for skills, calendars, availability, and appointments are complete and include the necessary business logic and validation. This is a significant accomplishment.
*   **Test Coverage**: The creation of integration tests and factories is a critical step and demonstrates a commitment to the project's quality goals.

### Immediate Priorities & Blockers

The following items are critical and require immediate attention:

1.  **Executing Tests**: The most urgent issue is that `npm test` has not been run. The project is set up to use Docker to provide the necessary `postgres` and `redis` services. Without running the existing tests, the backend cannot be considered complete or stable.
    *   **Action**: Please run `docker-compose up -d postgres redis` from the project root to start the required services in the background. Then, execute the test suite via `npm test` in the `backend` directory. All tests must pass before proceeding.

2.  **Availability Search Algorithm**: As noted, the search algorithm in `backend/src/services/availability.service.js` is currently a stub. This is the most critical and complex feature of Phase 1.
    *   **Action**: After verifying the test suite passes, this should be your primary focus. Please follow the detailed implementation guide in `docs/phase-1-implementation-plan.md` under section "3.3 Availability Search Algorithm".

### Next Steps

1.  **Run Existing Tests**: Get the test suite running and ensure all tests are green.
2.  **Implement Availability Search**: Develop the search algorithm, including slot expansion, conflict checks, and caching preparation. Add comprehensive unit and integration tests for this service.
3.  **API Documentation**: Begin creating the API documentation as planned. This can start with basic markdown files in `docs/api/` for each resource, as outlined in the implementation plan.

The frontend work is correctly identified as outstanding and can be deferred until the backend API is complete and verified.

Thank you for the great work so far. Let's focus on getting the tests running and completing the availability search to finalize Phase 1.

## Detailed Technical Feedback (Added by Technical Reviewer)

### Backend Progress Analysis

#### ✅ Excellent Work: Persistence Layer
- **Migrations Infrastructure**: Well-structured migration system in `backend/src/config/migrations/sql/`. This follows best practices.
- **Schema Coverage**: Comprehensive coverage from `tenants` → `appointments` + token blacklist demonstrates understanding of multi-tenant architecture.
- **Test Setup**: Jest global setup with automatic migration application and reset (backend/tests/setup.js:1) is exactly what Phase 0 and Phase 1 strategy called for.

**Specific praise:**
- Token blacklist table for logout revocation shows security-first thinking
- Proper foreign key relationships and constraints
- Migration versioning approach (assuming sequential numbering)

**Recommendations:**
1. Ensure all migrations include proper indexes as specified in phase-1-strategy.md:
   - `idx_users_email_tenant` on users(email, tenant_id)
   - `idx_appointments_calendar_time` on appointments(calendar_id, start_time, end_time)
   - `idx_calendar_skills_lookup` on calendar_skills(skill_id, calendar_id)
   - `idx_calendars_active` on calendars(is_active) WHERE is_active = true
2. Add rollback/down migrations for each up migration (future-proofing)
3. Document migration philosophy in `backend/src/config/migrations/README.md`

#### ✅ Excellent Work: Application Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns**: Split between `app.js` and `index.js` is clean and testable
- **Middleware Stack**: Structured error handling + auth + rate limiting + validation shows maturity
- **Router Organization**: Modular routers for each resource (`/auth`, `/skills`, `/calendars`, etc.)

**Specific praise:**
- Error handling middleware with proper HTTP status codes
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints (addresses phase-1-strategy.md security requirements)
- Validation utilities (likely express-validator integration)

**Recommendations:**
1. Ensure rate limiting configuration matches phase-1-strategy.md specs:
   - Login: 5 attempts per 15 min per IP
   - Register: 3 attempts per hour per IP
   - Refresh: 10 attempts per 15 min per IP
2. Add request logging middleware (Morgan) for observability
3. Verify helmet security headers are applied (already in package.json)
4. Add correlation IDs to requests for distributed tracing (future Phase 3 prep)

#### ✅ Excellent Work: Authentication System
Files mentioned: `backend/src/controllers/auth.controller.js:1`, `backend/src/services/auth.service.js:1`

**What's implemented correctly:**
- JWT issuance with refresh token flow
- Secure httpOnly cookies for refresh tokens (prevents XSS)
- Logout with token revocation via Redis + DB (dual-layer security)
- Separation of controller (HTTP) from service (business logic)

**Critical verification checklist:**
- [ ] JWT payload includes: `{ userId, tenantId, role, iat, exp }` (needed for Phase 2 RBAC)
- [ ] Access token TTL = 1h, Refresh token TTL = 7d (from .env.example)
- [ ] Bcrypt rounds ≥ 12 (security requirement)
- [ ] Password complexity validation: min 8 chars, 1 upper, 1 lower, 1 number
- [ ] Token rotation on refresh (issue new refresh token, invalidate old)
- [ ] Error messages don't leak "user exists" vs "wrong password"
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks

**Recommendations:**
1. **SECURITY AUDIT**: Before Phase 1 sign-off, run:
   ```bash
   npm audit
   npm audit fix
   ```
   Zero critical/high vulnerabilities required per roadmap.

2. **Token Blacklist Performance**:
   - If using both Redis AND DB for blacklist, ensure Redis is primary (fast lookup)
   - DB can be secondary/backup or audit log
   - Set Redis TTL = token expiry (auto-cleanup)

3. **Refresh Token Cookie Settings** (verify in code):
   ```javascript
   res.cookie('refreshToken', token, {
     httpOnly: true,
     secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
     sameSite: 'strict',
     maxAge: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 // 7 days
   });
   ```

4. **Add Missing Endpoint** (if not present):
   - `GET /api/v1/auth/me` - Returns current user info
   - This is required per roadmap Section 4.1

#### ✅ Strong Work: CRUD Implementation
Resources: Skills, Calendars, Availability Slots, Appointments

**What's working:**
- Validation + business rules implemented
- Unique skills per tenant (composite unique constraint)
- Timezone enforcement using IANA timezone list
- Slot overlap checks
- Conflict detection on appointments

**Critical verification for each resource:**

**Skills:**
- [ ] Unique constraint on (tenant_id, name)
- [ ] Category field validated against predefined list or free-form?
- [ ] Soft delete vs hard delete (consider audit trail)

**Calendars:**
- [ ] Timezone validation: `moment.tz.names()` includes provided timezone
- [ ] One user can have multiple calendars (one per service_type)
- [ ] `is_active` boolean controls visibility in searches
- [ ] ON DELETE CASCADE for related availability_slots

**Availability Slots:**
- [ ] `day_of_week` 0-6 (Sunday=0)
- [ ] CHECK constraint: `end_time > start_time`
- [ ] Recurring slots (not one-off appointments)
- [ ] Capacity ≥ 1 (allows concurrent bookings)

**Appointments:**
- [ ] Status enum: 'pending', 'confirmed', 'completed', 'cancelled'
- [ ] Only 'confirmed' status blocks calendar slots (critical for search algorithm)
- [ ] Minimum duration: 15 minutes (enforced in service layer)
- [ ] `required_skills` array stores skill UUIDs
- [ ] Start/end times stored as TIMESTAMPTZ (UTC)

**Recommendations:**
1. **Add Appointment State Machine**:
   - Document valid state transitions (pending → confirmed → completed)
   - Prevent invalid transitions (confirmed → pending should fail)
   - Add `transitioned_at` and `transitioned_by` for audit

2. **Soft Deletes for Audit Trail**:
   - Add `deleted_at` column to skills, calendars, appointments
   - Preserve booking history even if calendar deleted

3. **Batch Operations** (Phase 2 prep):
   - Consider bulk skill assignment to calendar
   - Bulk appointment status updates

#### ✅ Good Start: Integration Tests + Factories
Files: `backend/tests/integration/*.test.js`, test factories

**What's working:**
- Deterministic test data via factories
- Integration test coverage for all CRUD workflows
- Proper test isolation (transaction rollback per phase-1-strategy.md)

**Coverage targets per roadmap:**
- Auth utilities: 100% (unit)
- CRUD endpoints: All endpoints + error cases (integration)
- Availability search: 80%+ (unit + integration) - **PENDING**

**Recommendations:**
1. **Verify Test Isolation Pattern**:
   ```javascript
   beforeEach(async () => {
     await db.query('BEGIN');
   });
   afterEach(async () => {
     await db.query('ROLLBACK');
   });
   ```
   This ensures no test pollution.

2. **Factory Data Realism**:
   - Use `@faker-js/faker` for realistic names, emails, addresses
   - Generate valid timezones from `moment.tz.names()`
   - Ensure skill categories match domain (plumbing, electrical, etc.)

3. **Add Negative Test Cases**:
   - Duplicate email registration (409 Conflict)
   - Invalid timezone (400 Bad Request)
   - Overlapping appointment booking (409 Conflict)
   - Expired token access (401 Unauthorized)
   - Cross-tenant data access attempt (403 Forbidden - Phase 2)

4. **Test Coverage Report**:
   After running tests, generate coverage:
   ```bash
   npm test -- --coverage
   ```
   Aim for ≥80% for services, ≥60% overall.

### 🚨 Critical Outstanding Items

#### 1. **BLOCKER: Tests Not Executed**
**Risk Level: CRITICAL**

The fact that tests haven't been run yet is a major blocker. Code that isn't tested is considered non-functional.

**Immediate Action Plan:**
1. Start Docker services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d postgres redis postgres-test redis-test
   ```

2. Verify services are healthy:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   # Should show "Up (healthy)" for postgres and redis
   ```

3. Run backend tests:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm test
   ```

4. **Expected outcome:** All tests MUST pass. If any fail:
   - Log failures with stack traces
   - Fix issues before proceeding
   - Do NOT continue to availability search until tests are green

5. **If tests pass:** Take a screenshot/copy of test output showing:
   - Number of tests passed
   - Coverage percentages
   - Execution time
   This becomes the Phase 1 baseline.

**Common Issues to Watch For:**
- Database connection refused (check DATABASE_TEST_URL)
- Redis connection timeout (check REDIS_URL)
- Migration failures (check SQL syntax)
- Async timing issues (increase Jest timeout if needed)
- Transaction isolation failures (ensure proper setup/teardown)

#### 2. **CRITICAL PATH: Availability Search Algorithm**
**Risk Level: HIGH** (Most complex feature, blocks Phase 1 completion)

Current status: Stubbed at `backend/src/services/availability.service.js:124`

**This is the core business logic.** Everything else is CRUD scaffolding. The search algorithm is what makes this a booking system vs a simple calendar app.

**Implementation Requirements (per phase-1-strategy.md lines 257-343):**

**Step 1: `getCalendarsWithSkills(tenantId, skillIds)`**
- SQL must enforce AND logic: calendar has ALL required skills
- Use subquery with COUNT(DISTINCT skill_id) = length(skillIds)
- Return: calendar ID, provider info, timezone

**Step 2: `isFree(calendarId, startTime, endTime)`**
- Query appointments WHERE status = 'confirmed'
- Check for overlaps using interval logic
- Edge cases: exact matches, adjacent slots, 1-minute overlaps
- **CRITICAL**: Only 'confirmed' appointments block slots

**Step 3: Timezone conversion utilities**
- Use moment-timezone (already in package.json)
- Functions needed:
  - `convertToTimezone(datetime, fromTz, toTz)`
  - `isValidTimezone(tz)`
  - `getTimezoneOffset(tz, date)`
- **CRITICAL DST testing**:
  - March 10, 2024 (spring forward)
  - November 3, 2024 (fall back)

**Step 4: Main orchestrator `findAvailableSlots(searchParams)`**
- Validate inputs (duration 15-480 min, date range max 30 days)
- Get matching calendars (Step 1)
- For each calendar:
  - Get recurring availability_slots
  - Expand into concrete time windows for date range
  - Filter each window via isFree (Step 2)
  - Convert timezone (Step 3)
- Rank results (earliest first)
- Return top 50 slots with provider metadata

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **Don't cache yet** - Phase 3 feature
2. **Design functions as pure** (deterministic, no side effects)
3. **Log performance**: Measure search duration
4. **Return metadata**: Include `searchDuration`, `totalResults`, `cacheHit: false`

**Testing Requirements (MUST HAVE):**
- Unit tests for `isFree`:
  - No conflicts → true
  - Exact time match → false
  - Adjacent slots → true (9-10am, 10-11am = OK)
  - 1-min overlap → false
  - Pending appointment → true (doesn't block)
  - Cancelled appointment → true (doesn't block)
- Unit tests for timezone conversions:
  - PST → EST conversions
  - DST transitions
  - Midnight crossings
- Integration test for full search:
  - Create 2 calendars, 1 skill, 2 availability slots
  - Create 1 confirmed appointment (blocks one slot)
  - Search for skill → should return 1 available slot
- Performance baseline:
  - Generate 100 calendars, 1000 appointments, 50 skills
  - Search with 1 skill, 7-day window
  - Measure: p50, p95, p99 response times
  - Target: p95 < 200ms (Phase 3 goal, establish baseline here)

**Code Organization:**
```
backend/src/services/availability.service.js
├── getCalendarsWithSkills()      # Step 1
├── isFree()                       # Step 2
├── findAvailableSlots()           # Step 4 orchestrator
└── (helper functions)

backend/src/utils/timezone.js      # Step 3
├── convertToTimezone()
├── isValidTimezone()
└── getTimezoneOffset()

backend/tests/unit/services/availability.test.js
├── getCalendarsWithSkills tests (AND logic)
├── isFree tests (all edge cases)
└── Integration tests

backend/tests/unit/utils/timezone.test.js
└── DST edge case tests
```

**Recommended Development Order:**
1. Day 1: Timezone utils + unit tests (Step 3)
2. Day 2: isFree function + unit tests (Step 2)
3. Day 3: getCalendarsWithSkills + unit tests (Step 1)
4. Day 4: findAvailableSlots orchestrator (Step 4)
5. Day 5: Integration tests + performance baseline

**Acceptance Criteria (Phase 1 DoD):**
- [ ] All 4 steps implemented
- [ ] 80%+ code coverage on availability service
- [ ] All unit tests pass (including DST edge cases)
- [ ] Integration test demonstrates full flow
- [ ] Performance baseline documented
- [ ] API endpoint `/api/v1/search/availability` returns correct results
- [ ] Code reviewed by 2+ reviewers
- [ ] No TODO/FIXME comments in production code

#### 3. **Deferred (Correct Priority): Frontend + API Docs**

**Frontend:** Correctly deferred. API must be stable and tested first.

**API Documentation:** Can start in parallel with availability search:
- Create `docs/api/auth.md` documenting auth endpoints
- Create `docs/api/skills.md` documenting skills CRUD
- etc. for each resource
- Format: HTTP method, URL, request/response schemas, example cURL

**Phase 2 upgrade:** Generate OpenAPI/Swagger spec

### Test Execution Strategy

**When you run `npm test` for the first time:**

1. **Start fresh:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down -v  # Remove old volumes
   docker-compose up -d postgres redis postgres-test redis-test
   docker-compose ps       # Verify healthy
   ```

2. **Check environment:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   cat ../.env  # Verify DATABASE_TEST_URL points to postgres-test:5432
   ```

3. **Run with verbose output:**
   ```bash
   npm test -- --verbose --runInBand
   # --runInBand runs tests sequentially (easier debugging)
   ```

4. **If failures occur:**
   - Read error messages carefully
   - Check Docker logs: `docker-compose logs postgres redis`
   - Verify migrations applied: `docker-compose exec postgres psql -U booking_user -d booking_system_test -c "\dt"`
   - Test DB connection manually in backend/tests/setup.js

5. **Once passing, run with coverage:**
   ```bash
   npm test -- --coverage --coverageReporters=text --coverageReporters=html
   open coverage/index.html  # View coverage report
   ```
